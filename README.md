### üéØ How to Use

1. Input **only three things**:

   * Video **path** or **YouTube URL**
   * Video **language** (`en` for English, `hi` for Hindi)
   * **Word(s) or sentence** to search

2. You can enter:

   * **A single word** ‚Üí finds all occurrences of that word in the video.
   * **A full sentence** ‚Üí finds the exact sentence, partial phrases, and all individual words.
   * **Multiple words that may occur together or separately** ‚Üí finds each word individually, as well as any combination of the words appearing together.

3. Examples:

   * **English video**:

     * Search for `color` ‚Üí finds all mentions of "color".
     * Search for `machine learning basics` ‚Üí finds the full sentence, partial phrases, and individual words.
   * **Hindi video**:

     * Search for `paani` ‚Üí finds all mentions of ‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä, not "water".
     * Search for `mera naam gautam hai` ‚Üí finds the full sentence, partial phrases, and individual words.

4. Optional: **Fuzzy Matching**

   * Fuzzy matching finds **similar words** if the exact word isn‚Äôt pronounced clearly.
   * **Cutoff values** (0 to 1):

     * `0` ‚Üí very lenient, matches almost everything similar
     * `1` ‚Üí strict, matches only exact words
   * Example:

     * Searching `colour` in an English video, fuzzy cutoff `0.8` ‚Üí matches both `color` and `colour`.
     * Searching `paani` in Hindi video, fuzzy cutoff `0.9` ‚Üí matches only words very close to `paani`.

5. Output includes:

   * **Timestamps for each word**
   * **Timestamps for full sentences**
   * **Timestamps for partial matches** (all possible combinations)
  
> This ensures you never miss any important part of the video.
